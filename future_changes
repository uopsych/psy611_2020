GENERAL IDEA:
* move matrix algrebra to after t-tests
* make it two days
  * day 1: addition, subtraction, multiplication, etc
  * day 2: using matrix algebra to calculate means, group means, variance/covariance, t-tests (independent and paired)
  * more hands on in lecture

general lab feedback
* restructure first 3 labs to be "incomplete markdown format"***
* make the first minihack easy and walk them through it
* find out what was in the bootcamp and you can skim or gloss that content
* exercises throughout are good
* try to budget at least 20 minutes for mini-hacks
* is it possible to use the learnr package and have students download shiny apps to run on their computer?
* idea for the future: use learnr package to create labs, bundle these inside a package
* add in-text R code (reporting sample sizes, means, proper formatting, etc)
* add recaps at the beginning of lectures
* talk about folder organization
* import data files from GitHub for "lecture" part of lab; have students load in different data file for minihacks using working directory

* should we switch probability and dplyr labs?

TA expectations
* prep labs (minor tweaks), attend lecture, take quizzes and homework assignments (to give feedback on difficulty and time)
* less on statistical conclusion validity

homework general
* B's get degrees 
* don't say "it's in your best interest to attempt all of them"

homework-1.rmd
* include description of homework
* fix "link to data here"
* 10.1 -- clarify that you make the composite by following the steps in order
* 10.1 -- after "justify quantitatively" add, "You may suggest additional data collection as part of the jusitification process."
* 10.2 -- Write "using matrix algebra" at each step?
* 10.2 -- for Variance/Cov, what do you mean by "these data" (specify variables)

1-intro.html
* add slides that cover the following ideas:
 * Plan on "retaking" statistics over and over again. Attend workshops. GE for this course and 302. Teach statistics. Watch videos online. This is not material that you can fully understand after taking a stats course once through. 
 * My goals for this class: teach you how to teach yourself. Exposure to lots of ideas. Be ok with not knowing everything the first or second time.
 
 

2-validity.html
* more time with humor example/discussing article (requires curring some lecture material)

lab-1.html
* not enough time
* students using chat -- overwhelming, distracting
* cut out arithmatic stuff (not needed)


3-describing_data_1.html
* use rio to load in data, and explain ../ in file path
* add formula for standard deviation to in addition to R code for standard deviation

4-describing_data_2.html
* clarify "people attribute failures to back luck"
* examples from article -- maybe new examples or don't assign article?

lab-2.html
* 

5-matrix.html
* Explain the underlining element thing in matrix addition
* "Different from algebra" not "different from linear algebra"
* 1 = 1's not identity
* "Subtraction is not distributive is nonsensical"
* more about relation to statistics
* intimidating?
* pre and post multiplication


quiz-2.docx
* replace word "masquerade"

lab-3.html
* more practice with transformation matrices
  * build up from simple to complex
  * if we move matrix algebra to the end of the term and spread content out across two lectures, should be easier to focus on R code
  * don't name T matrix object "T" but call it "T_mat" or something

6-probability.html
* 

7-binomial.html
* fix slide 17 (confusing wording)

8-normal.html
* take out t, chi-sq, and F? -- maybe go over quickly? 

9-sampling.html
* add non-normal distribution example to excel spreadsheet

10-nhst.html
* "retain" not "fail to reject" the null
* that funny symbol is captial Pi (this just a tip)
* good to start with binomial (keep it up!)
* take out stuff about t-tests?

11-nhst.html
* online demo good (Kristoffer)
* change example with N = SD (confusing!)
* why is this good (sell it before you tear it down)

12-critiques.html
* writing cut off on slide 4 (maybe make figure smaller)
* "ee-one-ee-dees" (ioniddis)

lab-5.html
* dplyr
* pacing is good on this one! (30-40 min left over)
* primarily worked off the .Rmd file, not website
* included download link on the website -- students follow along in the Markdown

13-open_science.html
* good focus on stats not broad
* get a real explaination for publication bias
* another slide is cut off here
* arxiv, bioarxiv
* more practical advice (like at the end)
* good to be realistic (obstacles, slow science)

lab-6.html
* mini mini-hacks during lab worked well
* it's a little long, as always

2-homework.html


lab-7.html
* is this worth having?
* next time, chi-square
  * doing the test
  * frequency tables
  * output tables to word document
  * extracting information
  * in-line R code to summarize results
* or more on data wrangling
  * move summarize here
  * more about first one
    * tidy data
* pros: first year sem already covers some of this?

14-one-sample.html
* reiterate signal/noise

15-two-means_I.html (now 16)
* reiterate signal/noise
* add power

lab-8.html
* include welch's t-test
* good to have them walk through the steps
* had time to go through the mini-hacks
* add power

17-independent-sample.html
* make figures consistent with each other
* spell frequentist correctly

18-effect-sizes.html
* turn off scientific notation
* fix alterantive hypothesis for Levene's test
* pay attention to notation for standard deviation and standard error

  
CHANGES ALREADY ADDRESSED

schedule
* order should be one-sample t-test, paired sample t-tests, independent-samples t, effect sizes (cohen's d and overlap), assumptions and non-parametric tests


1-homework.Rmd
* rewrite correlation freedom/generosity instructions: "calculate the correlation between freedom and generosity" (take out thing about "for a country")
* 5.3 change validity of correlation to "statistical conclusion valdity"
* more time for homeworks? post 2 weeks in advance, instead of 1


12-critiques.html
* fewer quotes at the beginning (be prepared to run out of time) -- have extra day so leaving this in for now?

1-intro.html
* turn off notifications!

2-measurement.html
* Take out C&M? Replace with something else? Remove entirely? It's very dense, and maybe just too much. 

14-one_sample.html
* explain ()
* critical value dashed, test statistic solid lines

15-one_sample.html
* can be quick check 
* use one chi-square example throughout (don't switch back to lecture 14 example)
* change quiz 6 item to be about population mean, not sample mean
* add section here about shift in confidence intervals (95% CI around null mean, 95% around sample mean)

lab-7.html
* great work with Markdown
* maybe move up to week 3 (if moving matrix algebra moved to end of term)?
* on the other hand, nice to have a break from the challenging stuff mid-term
